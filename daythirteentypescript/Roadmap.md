Phase 2: Core Concepts of React
3. JSX (JavaScript XML)

Understand how JSX works and how it’s used in React components.

Learn how to embed expressions in JSX.

JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.

4. Components

Functional Components: The basic building blocks of React. Learn how to create and use them.

Class Components: Optional to learn now, but it’s good to understand them, especially when working with legacy code.

Components receive props (data passed from parent to child components).

5. Props

Learn how to pass data to components via props.

Understand the concept of "data flow" in React (unidirectional flow).

6. State

Learn how to use the useState hook for managing state in functional components.

Understand the difference between local component state and props.

Explore how state changes trigger re-renders.

7. Event Handling

Learn how to handle user interactions like clicks, form submissions, etc., using event handlers in React.

8. Conditional Rendering

Learn how to render different components or elements based on certain conditions (using ternary operators, logical operators, etc.).

9. Lists and Keys

Learn how to display dynamic data using .map() in React.

Understand the importance of using unique key props when rendering lists of elements.

Phase 3: Intermediate Concepts
10. React Hooks

useState: Already covered, but dive deeper into its usage.

useEffect: Learn how to perform side effects (e.g., fetching data, changing the DOM) inside functional components.

useContext: Share global state across components without passing props manually.

useRef: Use this to access DOM nodes directly or persist values across renders.

Custom Hooks: Learn how to create reusable logic using custom hooks.

11. Forms and Controlled Components

Learn how to create forms in React and handle user input.

Understand controlled components and managing form data via React state.

12. React Router (for Navigation)

Learn how to implement navigation in your app with React Router.

Understand how to create dynamic routes, nested routes, and route parameters.

13. Context API

Use the Context API to manage global state and avoid prop drilling.

Implement providers and consumers to share state across multiple components.

Phase 4: Advanced Concepts
14. Component Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)

Understand lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.

Learn how to use useEffect to replicate lifecycle methods in functional components.

15. Error Boundaries

Learn how to handle errors gracefully in React by implementing error boundaries.

16. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

Implement code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense to optimize loading times by loading only necessary code.

17. Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

Learn about HOCs, which are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or logic.

18. Memoization and Optimization

Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders for functional components.

Use useMemo and useCallback to optimize expensive computations and functions.

19. State Management Libraries

Learn how to scale your state management beyond React's built-in useState and useContext.

Popular libraries: Redux, MobX, Recoil, or Zustand.

Redux involves actions, reducers, and stores, and it's a great choice for large apps with complex state.

20. TypeScript with React (optional but highly recommended)

Learn TypeScript for type-checking React components.

Understand how to use types with props, state, and events in your components.
