## TypeScript

### Type Narrowing
- Type narrowing is the process of refining a variable's type within a conditional block of code. This allows you to write more precise and type-safe code.

- TypeScript provides several mechanisms for narrowing types, they include:

    1. Type guards
    2. The instanceof operator
    3. Intersection types
    4. Discriminated unions

#### Type Guards
- Type guards are mechanisms that help TypeScript understand and narrow down the types more precisely. One common type guard is the typeof operator.



#### The instanceof operator

- The instanceof operator is another type guard in TypeScript that allows you to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor function.
