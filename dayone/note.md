# React Intro

## Components

A component is a peace of the UI that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button
or large as an entire page.

React can be used to build mobile, desktop and VR


## Starting up a React App

To start up a project, use the command 

npm create-vite@latest

// your assets folder will have html files

// assets will have your images, svgs etc

// .gitignore contains list of folders you dont want to push to your github repo



## Components Explained

- Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JS functinos, but work in isolation and return HTML or JSX.

- A component is a function, the first letter must be in an upper case, and a component must return a html

- In order to render to the UI, use the export default command.

## JSX
- JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write 7 add HTML in React.

- JSX means JavaScript XML

- When working with JSX, you are only allowed to return one parent, there cant be multiple parents.

- In JSX, you have to close all your tags.

- You cant provide class using the class keyword, you have to use the className keyword.

- In JSX, html label element has no for attribute, instead, it is htmlFor

``` <label htmlFor="userName">Username</label>```


## Expressions in JSX

- With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces. The expressions can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid Javascript expression. JSX will execute the expression and return the result.


## Lists in JSX

- In React, you will render lists with some types of loop. The JavaScript map () array method is generally the preferred method.
