// the "reduce" method takes an array, and applies a callback function to condense the array into a single value

// it takes two values, the first is the accumulator, and the second is the current element in the array. The return value for the callback becomes the value of the accumulator on the next iteration.

// the reduce method should always have an initial value

// the  Set method is used to create a new set.

// calculate the square root as Math.pow(base, exponent)
